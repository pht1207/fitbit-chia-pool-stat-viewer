This is an app for Fitbit devices. It fetches data from an API made by spacefarmers.io.

The fitbit app gallery page for this application can be found here: https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/c04842b0-09af-4cbb-b871-927b7bf9497e?key=c04842b0-09af-4cbb-b871-927b7bf9497e.

The spacefarmers.io API is used to get stats regarding your cryptocurrency miner that is connected to their services.

Once the user has gone to the settings page of their app, they can input their wallet address. Then, data fetched from spacefarmers.io will display on the watch when the app is open.

Step by step, this is how the application works.
1. The user must open the settings page of the application on their phone and input their wallet address.
2. The phone will use this address and contact the spacefarmers.io API, fetching stats regarding their machine.
3. The phone will send this information to the smart-watch, and the watch will parse it in a way that allows it to be viewed on the watch's screen while the application is opened
