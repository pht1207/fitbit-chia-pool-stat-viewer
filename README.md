This is an app for the Fitbit sense and versa 3. It fetches data from an API made by flexpool.io.

The flexpool.io API is used to get stats regarding your cryptocurrency miner that is connected to their services.

Once the user has gone to the settings page of their app, they can input their selected coin type and wallet address. Then, data gathered from flexpool.io will display on the watch when the app is open.
