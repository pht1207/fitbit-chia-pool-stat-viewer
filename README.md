This is an app for Fitbit devices. It fetches data from an API made by spacefarmers.io.

The spacefarmers.io API is used to get stats regarding your cryptocurrency miner that is connected to their services.

Once the user has gone to the settings page of their app, they can input their wallet address. Then, data fetched from spacefarmers.io will display on the watch when the app is open.
